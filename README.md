# Abraham Getachew . Jarvis Consulting

I recently graduated from Heritage College, where I did a 3-year technical DEC in Computer Science covering programming, web development, and databases. As a full-stack developer, I bring a combination of technical knowledge and hands-on experience to the table. My background in computer science has given me a solid foundation in programming languages such as C#, Java SE, Python, and JavaScript. I have a proven track record of completing projects, including a coding challenge system for my college and a food mystery box delivery application that won 2nd place at a hackathon. My relevant experience as an IT developer and a technical support officer, as well as additional experience in restaurant and retail, has helped me develop strong problem-solving, analytical, and communication skills, and a solid understanding of the software development life cycle that enables me to tackle large problems within software-based approaches. I am a team player who is dedicated to delivering high-quality work and am always looking for new opportunities to grow and learn.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng-AbeGeta](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng-AbeGeta)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng-AbeGeta/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Designed and implemented an MVP that helps the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team to record the hardware specifications of each node of a Linux cluster and monitor node resource usage. The data collected is stored in an RDBMS to generate reports for future resource planning purposes. The users of this system are the LCA team, who will be writing SQL queries to answer business questions. Technologies used in this project include Linux command lines, Bash scripts, PostgreSQL, Docker, IDE, and networking protocols. The Linux cluster of 10 nodes/servers is internally connected through a switch and able to communicate through internal IPv4 addresses. The project aims to provide a solution for the LCA team to monitor the resources used by each node and plan future resource requirements effectively.

**RDBMS and SQL** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng-AbeGeta/tree/master/sql)]: Created SQL queries to retrieve data from multiple tables. A PostgreSQL instance using docker was utilized to load sample data and test the results of the queries. Git was used as version control for the project.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng-AbeGeta/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: 
  - JDBC App: The JDBC application performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a database using the JDBC API. A PostgreSQL database running in a Docker container was used, along with Maven to manage packages and dependencies and Git for version control.
  - Grep App: The Java Grep application mimics the grep command found in Linux. It searches for a text pattern recursively in a designated directory and writes matching lines to a file. The program was created using IntelliJ IDEA, an IDE with capabilities for building Java applications with Maven. The core java package was employed for reading and writing files using BufferedWriter, Stream API, and Lambda functions to navigate directories and files and write lines to a file. To build the project, Maven is used to create a JAR file and manage dependencies such as SLF4J for logging. Docker was used to deploy the application using a Dockerfile.

**Springboot App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng-AbeGeta/tree/master/springboot)]: Not Started

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng-AbeGeta/tree/master/python_data_anlytics)]: Not Started

**Hadoop** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng-AbeGeta/tree/master/hadoop)]: Not Started

**Spark** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng-AbeGeta/tree/master/spark)]: Not Started

**Cloud/DevOps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng-AbeGeta/tree/master/cloud_devops)]: Not Started


## Highlighted Projects
**Foodbox - McHacks 2023 2nd place winner, TELUS Sustainability challenge award** [[GitHub](https://github.com/AbeGeta/Foodbox)]: Built a platform to help reduce food waste by offering a 20% discount on items about to be thrown out by grocery stores using a "food mystery box" premise. The web application was developed using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, PostgreSQL and Python. The application was deployed using Vercel and used Git for version control

**Coding Challenge System - Team of 7** [[GitHub](https://github.com/AbeGeta/Coding-Challenge-System)]: Built a coding challenge system for our college to use that allowed students to solve coding problems and run their code against test cases made by teachers. C#, JavaScript, Entity Framework, and SQL were used to develop a web application that allowed students to practice coding challenges and track progress. Azure DevOps and Git were utilized for version control and collaboration on the project.

**Medical Adjudication Project - Employment and Social Development Canada**: Worked on a project in Visual Basic, JavaScript and SQL, creating web pages and generating reports of Medical Adjudication data. Stored procedures were written and maintained with Oracle SQL that support the user interface. Agile methodologies within the SDLC were used to manage and complete project tasks.
